# FullStackLab

Welcome to **FullStackLab**! This repository is a structured learning path designed for aspiring web developers who want to become proficient in full-stack development. **FullStackLab** guides you through projects ranging from basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript to advanced applications, using PHP & MySQL as the backend for full-stack projects.

## ðŸ“‘ Overview

**FullStackLab** is organized into five phases, each progressively introducing more complex concepts and projects:

- **Phase 1: Foundational Projects** â€“ Learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Phase 2: Interactive Projects** â€“ Build interactive apps with JavaScript, APIs, and local storage.
- **Phase 3: CRUD Applications** â€“ Dive into backend development with PHP & MySQL for data handling.
- **Phase 4: Full-Stack Mastery** â€“ Create complete applications with frontend-backend communication.
- **Phase 5: Advanced Projects** â€“ Tackle real-time features, IoT dashboards, machine learning, and more.

Each project comes with a clear objective, technology stack, and learning outcomes.
